# Caleb-Funk-creative-content

The primary objective of this repository is to serve as a centralized platform for sharing a collection of my personal and school projects 
developed during my academic journey and beyond. By making these projects openly available under the GNU General Public License 3.0, I aim to 
foster a collaborative environment where others can not only gain inspiration from my work but also contribute to and build upon these 
projects. This repository is a testament to the spirit of open source, encouraging the sharing of knowledge, ideas, and code within the 
academic and developer community. Whether you are a fellow student looking for insights, an enthusiast seeking inspiration, or a developer 
interested in collaborative efforts, feel free to explore, use, and contribute to the projects housed here.
